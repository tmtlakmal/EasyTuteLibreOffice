edited by the user.

1. User Type the formula in the document
2. User select the formula and click get solutions button
3. An interface with existing data will be recieved from Wolfram web service

    - alternative solutions
    - stepwise solutions
    - graphs
    - alternative representations
    - etc.
4. User can select whatever the information he or she need
5. Those will be added into the document
